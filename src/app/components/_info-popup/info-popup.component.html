      This text is intended to help you understand how this app works.
    <br>
    In a nutshell, the application works according to the following scheme:
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>1.</strong> We start by creating a goal, for instance 'I will run a marathon'. We do this by clicking on the sidemenu tab
    'My goals' and then by clicking on 'New Goal', a modal window will open, in which we create a new goal, where
    are various options to choose from, such as the field of life (career, knowledge, health), deadline, etc.
    <br><br>
    <strong>2.</strong> After creating the goal (point 1) click on the 'Calendar' tab -> here by clicking 'new task'
    for the created goal (point 1) we create individual tasks (tasks) to be performed.
    </p>
    <p>
      IMPORTANT:<br>
      1. 'My Goals' view is solely for GOALS creation<br>
      2. 'Calendar' view is solely for TASKS creation
    </p>
    <p>
      Other tools (charts) are used to measure progress and proportions between goals from different
    areas of life so as to help create a balance between individual spheres of life.
    In the 'settings' tab you can edit/change your profile details.
    </p>
    <p>
      In principle, the operation is similar to a work schedule, except that goals are not set within the work,
    only goals are about your life.
    </p>
    <p>You can always go back to this info window by click <span class="info-popup__icon"><i class="icon icon--info"></i></span> icon in the top right corner.</p>
    <p>Please enjoy the application.</p>
